# Don't Do This

## Don't

- Don't give attributes the same name as methods (the `import` saga) as this cause problems and crashes. Fixed by making them different.

- Don't put a space in `eval` expressions without quoting the whole

- Don't put a space in path causes "sprintf" type debugging in execfile to crash max!

- Don't develop in Package in Documents/... this causes issues due to icloud syncing.
